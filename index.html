                <h2><a href="https://onelifehealthcare.in/">One Life Home Healthcare</a></h2>
                <p>One Life Health Care offers premium home health care services for various kinds of patients who may require continued attentive health care services ranging from post-hospitalisation to end-of-life health care - all in the comfort of their own homes. Their key objective when they approached us, was to increase the number of online leads, for which their website needed a major upgrade.
We were entrusted with building out the flow, sitemap, content, layout, and design direction of their new 30+ page website. The website was to include dynamic functionalities, like an appointment booking system, payment portal, and the most interesting &#038; challenging one - a body map that would help visitors navigate to various healthcare services offered by One Life. 
With the view of getting the best possible results, we reached out to 5 different website vendors, evaluated each of them on 5 different key strengths we were looking for, and presented the client with the best alternatives. 
Over the next several weeks, we worked on creating the sitemap, rewriting &#038; creating content for the 30+ page website, as well as directing the layout, flow &#038; design of the website. The result? A beautiful cutting edge website with all of the dynamism and ease of navigation, simple &#038; understandable information that will not overwhelm a visitor, and one very happy client for Inception! </p>
